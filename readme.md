# The Fab Five Game

## Introduction
This is a project that I developed at Ironhack as part of their 2023 Web Development Bootcamp. It is a logic game, based on a German card game. This was a good opportunity to put our learned coding skills to practice, especially (and most of all) Javascript.

Since this is a project early in the class, I am sure there are still some things that I might want to change later on. Yet, I am still very very proud of my game.

## Setup
If youâ€™d like to view my game in your browser:

- `git clone https://github.com/fraulueneburg-ironhack/fab-five-game.git` in your terminal
- `cd fab-five-game`
- open `index.html`

## Rules
The rules are explained on the startscreen of the game as well as throughout the game.
