# The Fab Five Game

### 👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Play it at&nbsp;&nbsp;[fraulueneburg.github.io/fab-five-game/](https://fraulueneburg.github.io/fab-five-game/)

<br />

## Introduction

This is a project that I made at Ironhack as part of their 2023 Web Development Bootcamp. It is a logic game, based on a German card game. I’m especially proud that I built it entirely in Javascript, HTML and CSS – no canvas elements here.

I used svgs and embedded them inline via the `<use>` element. The colours are dynamically switched via CSS custom properties. The side comes with dark and light mode and scales to mobile (but is more fun on bigger devices).

## Features

- 😎&nbsp;&nbsp; nice simple gaming fun without signup
- ⏰&nbsp;&nbsp; time adapts when you’re fast
- 🌄&nbsp;&nbsp; random cheesy motivational quote when you’ve lost a round
- 🌈&nbsp;&nbsp; clever color switching via inline SVGs and CSS custom properties
- 🌙&nbsp;&nbsp; light and dark mode
