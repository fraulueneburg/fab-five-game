# The Fab Five Game

### ðŸ‘‰&nbsp;&nbsp;Play it at&nbsp;&nbsp;[fraulueneburg-ironhack.github.io/fab-five-game/](https://fraulueneburg-ironhack.github.io/fab-five-game/)
<br />

## Introduction
This is a project that I made at Ironhack as part of their 2023 Web Development Bootcamp. It is a logic game, based on a German card game. Iâ€™m especially proud that I built it entirely in Javascript, HTML and CSS â€“Â no canvas elements here. And it scales to mobile (but is much more on a bit bigger devices).  


## Setup

If youâ€™d like to view my game in your browser:

- `git clone https://github.com/fraulueneburg-ironhack/fab-five-game.git` in your terminal
- `cd fab-five-game`
- open `index.html`
- or, you know, just visit [the game demo](https://fraulueneburg-ironhack.github.io/fab-five-game/) and start the gaming fun right away ðŸš€

## Rules

The rules are explained on the startscreen of the game as well as throughout the game.
